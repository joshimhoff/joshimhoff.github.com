title: Notebooks, Laptops, and Oscillation
---

Since sophomore year of high school, I have had a romantic attachment to the notebooks I keep. They are not exciting -- many of the pages are filled with nothing but scheduling information and todos -- but I make sure to save each one on my bookshelf the second it is finished. The stuff in the notebooks that I really like is the notes on the different projects I am working on: Outlines of papers, programming project prototypes, even just random doodling. I want to be able to flip back through my notebooks when I am old and remember the state of my mind. The notebooks are an attempt to hold on to the past, for what will I do if I forget all my best ideas and develop a boring life of the mind?

I also do a lot of my writing on my computer. I have a folder titled “Journal” where I store entries in a fixed format. Sometimes I keep a folder of a Pages documents with double-spaced Helvetica 12-pt text. Sometimes I keep it even simpler -- a folder of txt’s. The date is on the top of every post. The whole thing is scarily obsessive.

At times I reach for my notebook and at other times I reach for my laptop. Which medium I choose has everything to do the seemingly random flutterings of my will. I choose one of the two mediums based simply on the mood that strikes me. 

Pen and paper are romantic. I control everything -- the curves of the characters, how messy my handwriting is, the spacing. If the feeling strikes me, I can draw the appropriate doodle next to some text. I can ignore the ledger lines and write diagonal across the page. I can change the color of my pen for the occasion at hand. The allure of the notebook is a feeling of freedom and self-expression all the way down.
    
And yet I reach for my laptop just as much. The reason is just as romantic. When I standardize the format of my writings, it is as if I am recording the words apart from petty concerns of style and formatting. Using a Pages document at all feels like too much. I want something purer -- something rawer -- something closer to a buffer of ASCII chars -- to just data, the genotype and not the phenotype. I will never really find what I am looking for. I really want to store my ideas apart from the language with which I speak; my mother tongue controls not only what I can communicate but also what I can think. II really want to store my ideas apart from any construct of language at all, for many of my ideas are more felt than thought out fully in English. I really want to store my ideas apart from my own mind -- so that the things in my head are real, concrete entities -- so that they are more than just my truths. What I am chasing after with my laptop is this romantic, impossible dream of meaning separate from interpretation -- of truth separate from perspective.

I am convinced that this oscillation between the desire to aggressively let out my whole self (my notebooks) and the desire to separate my ideas from my mind (my laptop) is the fundamental oscillation of my life. Buddhism and Plato -- anarchy and totalitarianism -- even Lisp and x86 assembly -- are all versions of the same oscillation. (And yet at the end of the day, the difference between my notebooks and my laptop is just as imagined and romantic as the reasons I use them for.)

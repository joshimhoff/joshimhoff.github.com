title: Arrogance and Abstraction
---

I am sometimes surprised by the arrogance of young programmers. (I am a young programmer, and I will not pretend that I am somehow totally free of this affliction, but try my best to be humble.) Yes, you can program. Great! You are capable of building all kinds of cool things for all kinds of people. You are a one-man team capable of barking orders at the most powerful tool man has ever made.

But do remember where all your power has come from. It has been said that we stand on the shoulders of giants. Let us enumerate the giants, one-by-one, whose shoulders we stand on, and figure out exactly how high in the sky we are lifted.

First of all, you might have some vague sense of how all the tools you use (bash, vim, git, etc.) work, but you probably don't read the source code of every tool you pick up. You certainly don't contribute to every project you benefit from. How could you? We only have so much time on this Earth, after all, and there is more to life than sitting in front of a computer screen.

Remember that programming might be the only profession in the world where the vast majority of high quality tools -- text editors, source control, *even whole operating systems* -- are available for free. Carpenters have to buy hammers and nails, painters have to buy paints and canvases, but we just head over to the magical land of Github and download away. (I realize that we do need to buy a computer, which does cost a pretty penny.)

You probably don't really know how your operating system works. You are either on OS X or Windows and don't have access to the source code, or maybe you have read a bit of the Linux source but probably not the whole thing. Even if you do know how your system works, you certainly did not write your own operating system from scratch. Remember that without your operating system, you would be without your job.

You probably do much of your programming in Python, Ruby, or Java. So do I; very high level languages are incredibly productive. More importantly, they are just plain fun to code in. You do realize though that every line of Python that you write is translated into many lines of C? That C is then translated into many, many of lines of assembly. (I use "translated" loosely here.) So for every line of Python I write, some programmer I've never met writes hundreds of lines of code for me.

Let's say that you program exclusively in C. Maybe C is the best language for the software you are writing, or maybe exclusively programming in C is another manifestation of your out-of-control ego. First of all, what happened to using the best tool for the job. If Python is fast *enough* for the problem you are trying to solve, and you can code more quickly and reliably in Python, why would you let principle (a proud man's worst enemy!) make you do more work than you need to?

Maybe, you think that because you avoid all the abstractions of higher level languages, you are somehow better and "purer." Because you do pointer arithmetic and bit shifting, you *really* understand what is going on in a computer. No, you don't. You understand C programming. Maybe you understand a little bit of assembly too. But you probably don't understand the current running through the circuits. You probably don't understand logic gates and the digital abstraction. (To be clear, neither do I!) You write 3 + 2; and think 5. Isn't it obvious? But do you know how electrical signals running through wires perform mathematical calculations? Even if you understand all this, your still eternally in debt to the guy who designed the microchip, the factory workers that put the chip together, and the professor whose mathematics laid the foundation for all of electric engineering.

The electrical engineers are in debt to the physicists, whose theoretical work is the mathematical basis for everything they create. Electrical engineers work with Kirchhoff's Voltage and Current Laws, not the nightmare that is Maxwell's Equations. That abstraction is possible because of people that are neither me nor you.

Despite all that theoretical physics has made possible, my point is *not* that physics is somehow the holy grail of man's progress. Even Schrodinger's equation is just a model -- an abstraction -- for what really happens in nature. It is a convenient equation to describe the physical world. The physicists are in debt to nature -- the only thing that really *is* -- for every man needs *something* to motivate their axioms and equations.

My point is *not* that you don't understand all this stuff. I bet you know far more about electric engineering and computer internals than I do. (I am a beginner in every sense of the word.) But I think all hackers forget to be grateful from time to time. There is something very God-like about wielding the power of code. You can build powerful things in the smallest of teams. There is nothing else quite like it in the world. Engineers need lots of raw materials, heavy machinery, and construction workers that constantly remind them that they are just men. Film makers need actors, cameras, and a hell of a lot of money. But we can create on our own, leaving us with a nasty God-complex.

Whenever I feel the hubris building inside of me, I remember all the people I am in debt to. I remember that everything I create is really the work of the many people before me. The fraction of the work that is *truly* mine is the smallest sliver imaginable. If anything is able to move a scientist to prayer, it is this.

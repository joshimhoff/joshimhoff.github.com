title: Abstractions are Generous
---

It is sometimes said that programmers stand on the shoulders of giants. (It is remarkable how much code has not only been written before us but also given to us free of charge.) The project of this essay is to enumerate the giants, one-by-one, whose shoulders we stand on, and figure out exactly how high into the sky we are lifted.

Programming might be the only profession in the world where the vast majority of high quality tools -- text editors, source control, *even whole operating systems* -- are available for free. Carpenters have to buy hammers and nails, painters have to buy paints and canvases, but we just head over to the magical land of Github and download away. (I realize that we do need to buy a computer, which does cost a pretty penny.) Remember that without operating systems, we would all be without jobs.

I do much of my programming in Python, Ruby, or Java. Very high level languages are not only incredibly productive to code in, but also are just plain fun. Every line of Python I write is translated into many lines of C. That C is then translated into many, many of lines of assembly. (I use "translated" loosely here.) So for every line of Python I write, some programmer I've never met writes hundreds of lines of code for me. How generous of him!

Even if I did program exclusively in C, I would still be in debt to the engineers who designed the chip and its instruction set. I have no desire to pick up assembly as my language of choice, but even assembly is an abstraction: I never once have to consider the current running through the circuits. Logic gates and processor design sure are over my head! I write 3 + 2; and think 5. Isn't it obvious? But I don't know *how* electrical signals running through wires perform mathematical calculations. Even if you understand all this, your still eternally in debt to the guy who designed the microchip, the factory workers that put the chip together, and the professor whose mathematics laid the foundation for all of electric engineering.

The electrical engineers are in debt to the physicists, whose theoretical work is the mathematical basis for everything they create. Electrical engineers work with Kirchhoff's Voltage and Current Laws, not the nightmare that is Maxwell's Equations. That abstraction is possible because of people that are neither me nor you.

Despite all that theoretical physics has made possible, my point is *not* that physics is somehow the holy grail of man's progress. Even Schrodinger's equation is just a model -- an abstraction -- for what really happens in nature. It is a convenient mathematical notation to describe the physical world. The physicists are in debt to nature -- the only thing that really *is* -- for every man needs *something* to motivate their axioms and equations.

Hackers sure do have a lot to be grateful for. There is something very God-like about wielding the power of code. We can build powerful things in the smallest of teams. There is nothing else quite like it in the world. Engineers need lots of raw materials, heavy machinery, and construction workers that constantly remind them that they are just men. Film makers need actors, cameras, and a hell of a lot of money. But we can create on our own, leaving us with a nasty *God-complex*.

Whenever I feel the hubris building inside of me, I remember all the people  -- all the code, really -- I am in debt to. I remember that everything I create is really the work of the many people before me. The fraction of the work that is *truly* mine is the smallest sliver imaginable. If anything is able to move a scientist to prayer, it is this.
